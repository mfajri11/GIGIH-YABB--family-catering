# README PLEASE

## INTRO
this is a final-project in backend track provided by YABB. the challange asking for a program that automate some business aspect. in this case is Food Catering. any specification of the challange describe at instruction.md

## DISCLAIMER!!
I don't provide propper UI flow because I still don't know the flow for order via WEB UI. But I provide some test on rspec for any model & it's behaviour explained at instruction.md. except, some of the Order's methods (which solved the bonus point parts) haven't tested yet. finaly, sorry for my english grammar.

## ASSUMPTION
based on my understanding from the instruction.md. I made some assumptions while working on this challange.
1. broadcast messages send manualy by the owner every morning.
2. I decide to not make a user/admin because this is a specific app for Gigih Family Catering owner & the specification doesn't talk anything for User cases (e.g valid for has password with length more than 8 etc.)
